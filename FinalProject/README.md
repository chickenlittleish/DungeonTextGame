I'm kidding I'm kidding

Mr. Bowman Just wanted to say that for my progress for this project, checking the timeline for the repository(checking it on the app) won't show my work progress.
This is because I ran into a problem while working and couldn't download the python extension to run my code so I couldn't get it to work on the app so instead I thought
I'll work on the web version as I can test my code there then copy and paste it into here(as I'm turning this in). Just saying that if you want to check the history, ask me, or just check the web version's history. Thank You.
